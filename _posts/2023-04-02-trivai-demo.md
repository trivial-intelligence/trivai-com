The rough rough Trivai demo is available for a limited time at [app.trivai.com](https://app.trivai.com).

Users are able to generate categories, view question sets, and provide thumb down feedback
for bad questions.

Currently performance is pretty bad, since the app sends all of its state on every re-render. ðŸ˜”

Upcoming features:
  * fact-check button for easy google searching
  * thumb up for good questions
  * score keeping
  * better performance
  * better appearance
  
If you have feedback, please email trivai@0x26.net.
