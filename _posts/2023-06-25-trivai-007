The double oh seven release of Trivia was cut today, with notable changes to the prompt
that generates the questions.

We're now using [OpenAI functions](https://yonom.substack.com/p/native-json-output-from-gpt-4)
to complete a machine readable JSON file instead of trying to convince the model to produce
valid JSON via text and examples. Now there are significantly fewer possibilities for unreadable
responses to category generation requests, and the generation itself is a bit faster. I think
the ability for the model to generate better and more interesting questions is also
improved since it now doesn't have to exert as much effort conforming to a particular schema.

Also, the code has been updated to work with the latest version of pynecone.

Also, I'm going to work for pynecone the company this week!
