I'm happy to announce the general availability of trivai 0.0.3, which improves
the performance of the UI and makes things a bit prettier. Nothing on the AI
or generation side has changed yet.

The really interesting work from this sprint however is the [server-side-originated
events](https://github.com/trivial-intelligence/trivai-app/blob/befa8a9d76d90ef466737b1f7c8dc49f741cc4e2/trivai_app/base.py#L47-L78) that facilitate the sharing of information and state between clients. For
example, as category completions are posted to the database, all clients will get
a refresh event, triggering a reload of the available categories.

```python
async def delayed_event(
    delay: float,
    state: State,
    name: str,
    payload: t.Optional[t.Dict[str, t.Any]] = None,
):
    """Submit a "frontend" event from the server for a particular client state."""
    event_dict = dict(
        token=state.get_token(),
        name=name,
        router_data=state.router_data,
    )
    if payload:
        event_dict["payload"] = payload
    sid = state.get_sid()
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    event_ns = _APP.sio.namespace_handlers["/event"]
    try:
        await event_ns.on_event(sid=sid, data=json.dumps(event_dict))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing delayed event: {e}")
```

(Note: `_APP` is set to the `pynecone.app.App` instance)

As far as I can tell, the event dispatching aspect of pynecone isn't documented
yet, but tapping into the `pynecone.app.EventNamespace` seems to the key for
processing server originated events and communicating between clients, which
will be needed down the road for "buzzer"-style play where each player uses
their own device (and thus pynecone server-side state).

This mechanism is also [used to implement periodic server-driver
refresh](https://github.com/trivial-intelligence/trivai-app/blob/befa8a9d76d90ef466737b1f7c8dc49f741cc4e2/trivai_app/genqueue.py#L23-L50)
of the pending genqueue items as long as there are pending items.

```python
asyncio.get_event_loop().create_task(
    delayed_event(
	delay=GQ_REFRESH_DELAY,
	state=self,
	name="state.genqueue_state.delayed_refresh_cb",
    ),
)
```

Ultimately, this timer logic should be driven on the client side, with server
side events only sent when there is actually data to update, but that remains
future work. For now, the server decides when the client should request an
update, but theoretically the server could send client side events directly.
Probably will hold off on sending direct client side events until the websocket
is stable.

## Upcoming features:
  * fact-check button for easy google searching
  * thumb up for good questions
  * user state: score keeping
    * multiple choice selection for automatic score keeping
