I'm happy to announce the general availability of trivai 0.0.3, which improves
the performance of the UI and makes things a bit prettier. Nothing on the AI
or generation side has changed yet.

The really interesting work from this sprint however is the server-side-originated
events that facilitate the sharing of information and state between clients. For
example, as category completions are posted to the database, all clients will get
a refresh event, triggering a reload of the available categories.

This mechanism is also used to implement periodic server-driver refresh of the
pending genqueue items as long as there are pending items. Ultimately, this timer
logic should be driven on the client side, with server side events only sent when
there is actually data to update, but that remains future work.

## Upcoming features:
  * fact-check button for easy google searching
  * thumb up for good questions
  * user state: score keeping
    * multiple choice selection for automatic score keeping

Thanks for your interest in trivai development.
